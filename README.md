Record game actions, play them back!

Dynamic record/playback implementation of the cloning mechanics I used in Quantum Pliot [ https://itunes.apple.com/app/id935956154 ], inspired by Kenta Cho's DefeatMe. Use this library to record game events and play them back later, like when making clones that imitate a player.

Sample implementation in imprint.html records the player's cursor position & color each frame. When the player clicks, the program begins playback, painting the same position & color where the player drew.
